Overview: 

Our final project’s goals were to find the shortest path between any two airports by distance given airlines and route information from https://openflights.org/data.html. To accomplish this, our team used BFS to implement a graph of the routes, and then used Dijkstra’s and A * algorithm to find the shortest paths between any two airports.
