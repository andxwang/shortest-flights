## Week 1

Made contract


## Week 2

Created make file  
Created test and catch files  
Got data and started working on loading it in  
Everyone worked well together  

Andy: Load data into vector  
Minjoong: Test cases for the loaded data  
Henry: Implement BFS  
Abhyan: Write BFS tests  


## Week 3
Discussed MakeFile  
Removed unused func readFromFile  
Discussed /N entries in routes.dat and airports.dat file  
Fixed MakeFile to allow testing  
Worked with FlightAlgorithms constructor   
Dropped entries with /N values in destination code of routes.dat  
Modified BFS to allow for compiling  
Removed parameters from main()  
Created FlightAlgorithms object in main  
Assigned Djikstras and A* algorithms to be implemented  

## Week 4
Implemented Djikstra's algorithm  
Worked through simple test cases to verify BFS and Djikstra's is working  
continuing to work on A* algorithm.  
Continuing to write more complex test cases  

## Week 4.5
* Debugged Dijkstra's and A* algorithms.
* Fixed Dijkstra's algorithm
* Tested on route starting from DAB (Daytona Beach) to PER (Perth). Found result to be DAB -> ATL -> DFW -> BNE -> PER
