## Team Contract (abhyanj2-msk6-andyjw2-henrywu3)

### Communication

1. **Team Meetings** Our team will meet once a week every Thursday evenings using Zoom.
   We'll all contribute to a meeting agenda that goes over what was discussed at the meeting each week
2. **Assistance** Each team member can be contacted through email ({abhyanj2,msk6,andyjw2,henrywu3}@illinois.edu). Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours.
3. **Respect** The note-taker for the week will also serve as the "project lead" for the weekly meeting. Their role is to ensure that every member of the group has had a chance to speak or state their opinion about a design decision. However, design decisions can be accepted by simple majority - while unanimous agreement is preferred, it is not required. Each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.

### Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution** Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned the task.
2. **Time Commitment** Each member is expected to work no less than 2 and no more than 6 hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication.
3. **Conflict Resolution**
In the case of a disagreement or conflict, the disagreeing parties will enter into the Coliseum, where both parties will be given a sword and made to duel till death. The winner of the duel will then proceed with their idea/opinion. We’ll go with the majority’s opinion and if there’s a tie we’ll look to a third-party (probably our mentor) for a solution.
